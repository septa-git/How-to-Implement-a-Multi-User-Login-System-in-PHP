# How to Implement a Multi User Login System in PHP with MYSQL Technology

A multi user login system is a web application that allows multiple users to register, login, and access different features based on their roles or permissions. For example, an online shopping website may have different types of users such as customers, sellers, and administrators, each with different functionalities and access levels. To implement a multi user login system in PHP, we need to use MYSQL as the database to store the user information, such as username, password, email, role, etc. We also need to use PHP sessions to keep track of the logged in users and their roles. The basic steps to create a multi user login system in PHP with MYSQL are:

Create a database and a table to store the user information.
Create a registration form to allow users to sign up with their username, password, email, and role.
Create a login form to allow users to enter their username and password and verify them with the database.
Create a session variable to store the user id and role after a successful login.
Create different pages or features for different user roles and check the session variable to grant or deny access.
Create a logout button to destroy the session and redirect the user to the login page.
